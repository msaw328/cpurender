required SDL2 to build

SDL2 used only to display a window (Xlib is ugly and xcb lacks documentation, couldnt make it work the way i wanted)
all rednering done on cpu through setup() and nextframe() functions in main.c

build with
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

produced binary is build/bin/cpurend
